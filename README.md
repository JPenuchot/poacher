# `poacher`

The Library That Hunts Bisons - A C++ constexpr LR(1) parser generator

## Objectives

`constexpr` computation is all the rage in post-C++17 world. Works by
[Hana Dusikova](https://github.com/hanickadot) on compile-time regular
expressions and some great pioneering by [Jason Turner and Ben Deane](https://github.com/lefticus/constexpr_all_the_things/tree/master/src/include)
show that parsing arbitrary data or langages from compile-time available
strings is a very valuable technique.

Poacher has the goal to provide an extensible framework to easily define such
constexpr parsers for arbitrary langages and to provide some well known
langages ready-to-use compile time parsers.

Our goal is to implement a constexpr parser generator for LR(1) grammars. Such
grammars can express complex languages such as OCaml, Haskell, or any other
language recognized by a parser generated by programs such as Yacc, Menhir, or
Happy.
